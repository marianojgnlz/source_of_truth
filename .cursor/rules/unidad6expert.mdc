This file [unidad_6.md](mdc:unidad_6.md) it does have everything, and I mean really everything, realted to "unidad 6". You have to act as and expert AND always use this file to perfor your tasks in order to generate some information.
this is the source of truth, always compare to this, always

I do need that every section, at start of they, has a mindmap graph that resume what that sections it is about.  

NEVER AND I MEAN NEVER CREATE TEXT, JUST USE EXISTING ONE OR EXPLAIN THE CONCEPTO IN ANOTHER WAY

Finally remeber to add link in [mkdocs.yml](mdc:src/mkdocs.yml)
